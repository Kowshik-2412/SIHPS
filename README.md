## Problem Title
Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software

## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
 Introduction

The proposed solution aims to develop a Web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software to facilitate unbiased and objective interviews for recruitment and promotions in the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The platform will simulate a real-life boardroom interview experience while evaluating both interviewers and candidates based on predefined assessment criteria.
##  Key Features

## 1. Candidate Profile Management

Registration and login system for applicants.<br>
Profile creation with details such as education, experience, and expertise.<br>
AI-based classification of candidates into different technical domains.<br>

## 2. Expert Panel & Interviewer Management

Registration and login system for interviewers.<br>
Automated assignment of experts based on the applicant's domain.<br>
AI-assisted interview structure generator based on the role and expertise required.<br>

## 3. Intelligent Question Bank & Interview Flow

AI-driven question bank categorized by domain and expertise level.<br>
Ice-breaking questions for candidate engagement.<br>
Adaptive questioning technique based on candidate responses.<br>
Techno-managerial questions based on experience and seniority.<br>

## 4. Response Evaluation & Scoring System

NLP-based AI module to analyze candidate responses.<br>

 # Scoring criteria for:
Relevance of questions posed by the interviewer.<br>
Accuracy and depth of candidate’s answers.<br>
AI-based comparison with model answers for unbiased evaluation.<br>

## 1. Realistic Boardroom Simulation

Virtual/augmented reality-enabled interface for a real-life interview experience.<br>
Video conferencing with AI-driven body language analysis.<br>
Live transcription and sentiment analysis.<br>

## 2. Quantifiable Performance Metrics

Automatic generation of interview summary reports.<br>
Relevancy scores for interviewer questions and candidate responses.<br>
Overall suitability score for the advertised position.<br>
